# IBM Quantum Platform Connection Status Report
**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Status:** CONNECTION BLOCKED - ACCOUNT SETUP REQUIRED  
**Classification:** TECHNICAL INTEGRATION REPORT  

---

## Connection Attempt Results

### API Key Testing ❌
**Provided API Key:** `ApiKey-be819e2d-0b3a-4e3a-a22d-92b341aaa9f9`

**Connection Tests:**
```
Channel: ibm_cloud - FAILED: "Unable to retrieve instances."
Channel: ibm_quantum_platform - FAILED: "Unable to retrieve instances."
```

### Error Analysis
The error "Unable to retrieve instances" indicates that while the API key format is correct, the IBM Quantum account requires additional setup steps.

## Required Actions for Real IBM Connection

### 1. IBM Quantum Account Verification
**You need to:**
- Login to https://quantum.ibm.com
- Verify your account is active and in good standing
- Check that the API key `ApiKey-be819e2d-0b3a-4e3a-a22d-92b341aaa9f9` is listed in your account
- Confirm the API key has not expired

### 2. Service Instance Setup
**Check for:**
- Quantum service instances properly configured
- Billing/usage plan activated (if required)
- Account permissions for quantum hardware access
- Usage quotas and limits

### 3. Backend Access Rights
**Verify:**
- Access to quantum backends (ibm_brisbane, ibm_torino, ibm_kyoto)
- Proper service tier subscription
- Any pending account verifications or approvals
