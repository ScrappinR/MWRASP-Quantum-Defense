<p><h1>CERTIFICATION OF MICRO ENTITY STATUS</h1><br/><h2>(Gross Income Basis) 37 CFR 1.29(a)</h2><br/><br/><h3>APPLICATION OR PATENT UNDER CONSIDERATION</h3><br/><br/><strong>Application Number (if applicable):</strong> ________________  <br/><strong>Filing Date (if applicable):</strong> ________________  <br/><strong>Patent Number (if applicable):</strong> ________________  <br/><strong>First Named Inventor:</strong> Brian Rutherford  <br/><strong>Attorney Docket Number:</strong> RUTHERFORD-003-PROV  <br/><strong>Title of Invention:</strong> Clandestine AI Agent Communication Through Computational Biometric Channels and Steganographic Behavioral Pattern Modulation  <br/><br/><h3>CERTIFICATION</h3><br/><br/>I hereby certify that I qualify for micro entity status under 37 CFR 1.29(a) and that the following statements are true:<br/><br/>☑ I qualify as a small entity as defined in 37 CFR 1.27, without relying on a government use license exception under 37 CFR 1.27(a)(4).<br/><br/>☑ Neither I, nor the inventor(s), nor a joint inventor has been named as the inventor or a joint inventor on more than four previously filed patent applications, other than applications filed in another country, provisional applications under 35 U.S.C. 111(b), or international applications filed under the treaty defined in 35 U.S.C. 351(a) for which the national stage fees were not paid.<br/><br/>☑ In the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, the gross income of myself and all individuals or entities to whom I have assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed (or am obligated under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or license) any rights in the invention did not exceed $241,830 (the maximum qualifying gross income limit for 2025).<br/><br/>☑ I have not assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed (and am not under an obligation under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or license) any rights in the invention to any entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income that exceeded $241,830 (the maximum qualifying gross income limit for 2025).<br/><br/><h3>WARNING</h3><br/><br/>Any attempt to fraudulently establish status as a micro entity, or pay fees as a micro entity, shall be considered as a fraudulent attempt to evade payment of fees. Improperly, and with intent to deceive, establishing micro entity status or paying micro entity fees shall be deemed to be fraud practiced or attempted on the Office. 37 CFR 1.29(k)(1)<br/><br/>Micro entity status, once established, remains in effect until changed. Any change in status must be filed in writing in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest of the issue fee or any maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a micro entity is no longer appropriate. See 37 CFR 1.29(i). Failure to notify the Office of a change in entitlement to micro entity status and attempted payment of a micro entity fee when micro entity status is not appropriate, shall be considered to be fraud practiced or attempted on the Office. 37 CFR 1.29(k)(1)<br/><br/><h3>SIGNATURE</h3><br/><br/><strong>Signature:</strong> /Brian Rutherford/  <br/><strong>Name (Print/Type):</strong> Brian Rutherford  <br/><strong>Date:</strong> [To be filled]  <br/><strong>Registration No. (if applicable):</strong> N/A  <br/><strong>Telephone:</strong> (512)648-0219  <br/><br/>☑ Applicant ☐ Patent Practitioner (specify registration number above)</p>
