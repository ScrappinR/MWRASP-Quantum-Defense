BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention
[0003] The present invention relates to defensive cybersecurity platforms utilizing 
quantum computing benchmark correlation for threat detection, specifically systems 
that translate real-time quantum performance metrics (qubit counts, coherence 
times, error rates) into network traffic risk scores through a Mathematical Woven 
Responsive Adaptive Swarm Platform (MWRASP Total) employing hierarchical AI agent 
communication protocols for enterprise security.

Description of Related Art
[0004] Current quantum security approaches fail to correlate specific quantum 
computing benchmarks with network traffic patterns. While post-quantum cryptography 
standards address future encryption, no existing systems translate quantum 
performance metrics (qubits, coherence times, error rates) into actionable risk 
scores for current network traffic. This creates a critical gap where organizations 
cannot assess which encrypted data faces imminent decryption risk based on actual 
quantum computing progress.

[0005] Existing multi-tier security architectures, including Samsung's six-tier 
BDI system (US20200234166), lack quantum-specific communication protocols and 
fail to dynamically adjust consensus mechanisms based on quantum advancement 
indicators. Traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant systems operate with static 
thresholds that cannot adapt to the exponentially changing quantum threat landscape.

[0006] Current swarm-based security platforms employ simple aggregation mechanisms 
without mathematical weaving of AI agent responses. They lack the sophisticated 
data fusion required to correlate quantum benchmarks with network patterns, 
resulting in inability to detect harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) attacks before 
quantum computers achieve cryptographic relevance.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007] The present invention provides a quantum benchmark-driven temporal correlation 
system within the MWRASP (Total) framework that uniquely translates specific quantum 
computing metrics (qubit counts, coherence times, gate fidelities, error rates) 
into network traffic risk scores through a novel mathematical mapping mechanism. 
The system employs hierarchical AI agent communication protocols with quantum-
influenced decision fusion, fundamentally differentiating from static multi-tier 
architectures.

[0008] The invention's mathematical weaving architecture synchronizes AI agent 
responses through tensor product operations, eigenvalue decomposition, and quantum-
inspired entanglement measures, creating a responsive adaptive swarm that evolves 
with quantum computing advancement.

Abstract
A quantum benchmark-driven temporal correlation system for detecting harvest-now-
decrypt-later (HNDL) attacks that uniquely translates specific quantum computing 
metrics (qubit counts, coherence times T1/T2, gate fidelities, error rates) into 
network traffic risk scores through novel mathematical mapping. The system implements 
hierarchical AI agent communication protocols with four quantum-optimized tiers 
(Sentinel, Analyst, Strategist, Commander) using dynamic consensus thresholds 
adjusted by quantum advancement metrics, differentiating from static multi-tier 
prior art. The Mathematical Woven Responsive Adaptive Swarm Platform (MWRASP Total) 
employs tensor product operations, eigenvalue decomposition, and phase-locked 
synchronization to weave AI agent responses into coordinated defensive actions. 
The temporal correlation engine uses the formula risk = Q_factor × C_factor × 
T_overlap × exp(-years_to_threat/10) to quantify threats, while tier weights shift 
from sentinel-emphasis (0.4) at far-future threats to commander-emphasis (0.25) 
at near-term threats. This enables proactive enterprise defense against quantum 
decryption threats through mathematically rigorous response coordination.
