BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

[0001] The present invention relates to cybersecurity systems for detecting quantum computing threats, specifically systems and methods for identifying and preventing harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) attacks where adversaries collect encrypted data today for future decryption using quantum computers.

Description of Related Art

[0002] The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current cryptographic systems. Experts predict that cryptographically relevant quantum computers capable of breaking RSA-2048 and ECC-256 will emerge between 2030 and 2040. This creates an immediate vulnerability: adversaries are currently harvesting encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computers become available.

[0003] Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms lack the capability to detect HNDL attacks because these attacks appear as legitimate data access patterns. Current solutions focus on preventing data exfiltration rather than detecting the subtle behavioral patterns indicative of systematic harvesting for future decryption.

[0004] Existing network monitoring tools fail to distinguish between normal bulk data transfers and malicious harvesting operations. The challenge is compounded by the fact that HNDL attacks may be conducted by insider threats or through compromised credentials, making traditional perimeter-based security ineffective.

[0005] Without effective detection mechanisms, organizations cannot identify which data has been compromised for future decryption, making it impossible to assess risk or implement appropriate countermeasures such as re-encryption with quantum-resistant algorithms.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] The present invention provides a comprehensive system and method for detecting harvest-now-decrypt-later quantum computing attacks through advanced behavioral anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and risk assessment.

[0007] The system employs multiple detection mechanisms including entropy-based traffic analysis, temporal pattern recognition, data value assessment, and cross-correlation with global threat intelligence to identify potential HNDL attacks with high accuracy while minimizing false positives.

[0008] A key innovation is the multi-layered AI agent architecture that combines unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, supervised learning for attack classification, and reinforcement learning for adaptive response optimization, enabling the system to evolve with emerging attack patterns.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

System Architecture

[0017] The invention implements a distributed architecture comprising multiple specialized AI agents operating in coordination to detect HNDL attacks. The system includes: (1) Data Collection Agents that monitor network traffic, file access patterns, and user behaviors; (2) Analysis Agents that perform entropy calculations, pattern matching, and anomaly detection; (3) Correlation Agents that integrate multiple data sources and threat intelligence; (4) Response Agents that execute mitigation strategies; and (5) Learning Agents that continuously improve detection accuracy.

[0018] Each AI agent operates autonomously while sharing information through a secure message bus, enabling real-time collaborative threat detection without creating single points of failure.

Entropy-Based Traffic Analysis

[0019] The system employs sophisticated entropy analysis to identify data flows characteristic of HNDL attacks:

H(X) = -sum(p(xi) * log2(p(xi)))

where H(X) represents Shannon entropy, and p(xi) represents the probability of data pattern xi.

[0020] High-entropy data flows, particularly those targeting encrypted databases or communication archives, trigger elevated risk scores. The system maintains baseline entropy profiles for normal operations and flags deviations exceeding configurable thresholds.

[0021] Entropy analysis extends beyond simple calculations to include:
- Temporal entropy variations indicating systematic harvesting
- Spatial entropy distribution across network segments
- Cross-entropy between expected and observed patterns
- Relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) for anomaly quantification

Behavioral Pattern Recognition

[0022] The system implements multiple pattern recognition algorithms to identify HNDL attack signatures:

1. Temporal Pattern Analysis: Detects unusual access timing, particularly during low-activity periods when monitoring may be reduced.

2. Access Pattern Analysis: Identifies systematic traversal of encrypted data stores, especially focusing on long-term valuable data.

3. Volume Pattern Analysis: Monitors for gradual, persistent data collection designed to avoid triggering traditional DLP thresholds.

4. User Behavior Analysis: Profiles normal user activities and flags deviations indicative of compromised accounts or insider threats.

[0023] Pattern recognition employs a combination of:
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for sequence analysis
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dependencies
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial pattern detection
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for relationship mapping

Data Criticality Assessment

[0024] The system automatically classifies data based on its potential value to quantum adversaries:

Risk_Score = f(Encryption_Strength, Data_Longevity, Business_Value, Regulatory_Impact)

[0025] Classification considers:
- Encryption algorithms used (RSA, ECC, AES key sizes)
- Data retention requirements and lifecycle
- Intellectual property and trade secret identification
- Personal information subject to privacy regulations
- Financial data with long-term value
- Government classified information levels

Machine Learning Implementation

[0026] The core detection engine employs an ensemble learning approach combining multiple algorithms:

1. Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection
2. Random Forest for supervised attack classification  
3. Deep Neural Networks for complex pattern recognition
4. Reinforcement Learning for response optimization

[0027] The ensemble model aggregates predictions using weighted voting:

Final_Prediction = sum(wi * Pi) / sum(wi)

where wi represents model weights based on historical accuracy, and Pi represents individual model predictions.

[0028] Model training incorporates:
- Synthetic HNDL attack data generation
- Transfer learning from related security domains
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration
- Continual learning to adapt to evolving threats

Real-Time Correlation Engine

[0029] The correlation engine integrates multiple data sources:
- Internal network traffic and system logs
- External threat intelligence feeds
- Dark web monitoring for data broker activity
- Quantum computing advancement tracking
- Geopolitical risk indicators

[0030] Correlation algorithms employ:
- Pearson correlation for linear relationships
- Spearman correlation for monotonic relationships
- Mutual information for non-linear dependencies
- Granger causality for temporal relationships

Risk Scoring and Prioritization

[0031] The system generates quantum risk scores for all monitored assets:

Quantum_Risk = Threat_Probability * Vulnerability_Score * Impact_Magnitude * Time_Factor

[0032] Time_Factor accounts for the decreasing time until quantum computers can break current encryption:

Time_Factor = 1 / (Years_Until_Quantum_Threat)^2

[0033] This exponential increase reflects the accelerating quantum computing development and the urgency of addressing HNDL attacks.

Automated Response Mechanisms

[0034] Upon detecting potential HNDL attacks, the system executes graduated responses:

1. Low Risk (Score < 30): Enhanced monitoring and logging
2. Medium Risk (30-70): Alert security team, implement additional authentication
3. High Risk (70-90): Isolate affected systems, force re-encryption
4. Critical Risk (>90): Emergency shutdown, full incident response activation

[0035] Response mechanisms include:
- Dynamic firewall rule updates
- Automatic session termination
- Forced multi-factor authentication
- Quantum-resistant algorithm deployment
- Honey token insertion for attack tracking
- Legal evidence preservation

Quantum-Safe Migration Planning

[0036] The system includes migration planning capabilities:
- Inventory of all cryptographic implementations
- Vulnerability assessment against quantum algorithms
- Priority ranking for migration efforts
- Resource requirement estimation
- Implementation timeline generation
- Compatibility testing frameworks

- Edge computing for reduced latency
