## TECHNICAL FIELD

This invention relates to cybersecurity systems that provide quantum-resistant security through temporal fragmentation of data with automatic expiry mechanisms, creating time-limited attack windows that prevent prolonged quantum computing attacks.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Current Data Protection Methods

Traditional data protection relies on:
1. **Encryption at Rest**: Data encrypted while stored, vulnerable to key compromise
2. **Encryption in Transit**: Data encrypted during transmission, vulnerable to endpoint attacks
3. **Access Control**: Permission-based data access, vulnerable to credential theft
4. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Detection and prevention of unauthorized data exfiltration

### Quantum Computing Threats to Data Security

**Shor's Algorithm Impact**:
- Breaks RSA, ECC, and other public-key cryptography
- Compromises long-term data confidentiality
- Creates retroactive decryption threats for stored encrypted data

**Grover's Algorithm Impact**:
- Reduces effective key length of symmetric ciphers by half
- AES-256 becomes equivalent to AES-128 security level
- Accelerates brute-force attacks on encrypted data

**Extended Attack Windows**:
- Quantum computers can work on encrypted data indefinitely
- Stolen encrypted data remains vulnerable until quantum computers mature
- Current encryption provides no temporal protection boundaries

### Prior Art Limitations

**Secret Sharing Schemes (Shamir's Secret Sharing)**:
- Mathematical threshold schemes vulnerable to quantum attacks
- No temporal constraints on reconstruction
- Requires trusted parties to hold shares indefinitely

**Time-Lock Puzzles**:
- Rely on computational assumptions that may be broken
- No guaranteed upper bound on solution time
- Vulnerable to parallel quantum computation

**Data Retention Policies**:
- Manual deletion processes with compliance gaps
- No automatic enforcement of temporal constraints
- Cannot protect against attacks on existing copies

**Homomorphic Encryption**:
- Allows computation on encrypted data but still vulnerable to quantum attacks
- No temporal security boundaries
- Significant computational overhead

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a **Temporal Fragmentation Security Engine** that creates time-limited data fragments with automatic expiry mechanisms, ensuring that sensitive data becomes inaccessible after predetermined time periods regardless of computational advances. The system combines data fragmentation with cryptographic temporal constraints to create quantum-resistant security through time-bounded attack windows.

### Core Innovation Elements

1. **Temporal Fragmentation Engine**: Splits data into fragments with individual expiry timestamps
2. **Cryptographic Time Locks**: Implements cryptographically enforced temporal constraints
3. **Automatic Fragment Expiry**: Ensures irreversible data deletion after time limits
4. **Distributed Temporal Validation**: Validates fragment freshness across multiple systems
5. **Quantum-Resistant Temporal Security**: Provides security independent of computational advances

### Technical Advantages

- **Time-Bounded Security**: Attack windows limited by fragment expiry times
- **Quantum Attack Prevention**: Prevents extended quantum computation on data
- **Automatic Security Enforcement**: No manual intervention required for security
- **Flexible Time Constraints**: Configurable expiry times from seconds to months
- **Retroactive Protection**: Existing data fragments automatically expire

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

1. **Data Fragmentation Controller** - Splits data into temporal fragments
2. **Cryptographic Time Lock Manager** - Implements temporal constraints

        # Determine fragmentation parameters based on security level
        fragment_params = self.get_fragmentation_parameters(security_level)
        
        # Generate unique fragment session ID
        session_id = self.generate_session_id()

            fragments.append(self.serialize_fragment(fragment))
            
        return fragments
```

**Novel Aspects**:
- **Temporal Jitter**: Prevents synchronized expiry attacks
- **Cryptographic Time Locks**: Mathematically enforced time constraints
- **Information-Theoretic Fragmentation**: Each fragment provides no information alone

### Component 2: Cryptographic Time Lock Manager

**Purpose**: Implement cryptographically enforced temporal constraints that cannot be bypassed even with unlimited computational power.

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class CryptographicTimeLockManager:
    def __init__(self):

        }
```

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Time-Lock Security = min(Computational_Delay, Fragment_Expiry_Time)

Where:
- Computational_Delay = t × Operations_Per_Second^(-1)
- Fragment_Expiry_Time = configured expiry timestamp
- t = number of required sequential operations

Security Guarantee: 
Data becomes inaccessible when min(time_lock_expires, fragment_expiry) occurs
```

### Component 3: Fragment Expiry Enforcement Engine

**Secure Deletion Guarantees**:
- **Multi-Pass Overwriting**: 7-pass random data overwriting (US DoD standard)
- **Cryptographic Key Destruction**: All decryption keys irreversibly destroyed
- **Memory Clearing**: All memory locations containing fragment data overwritten
- **Database Vacuuming**: Deleted database records permanently removed from storage

## DRAWINGS

### Figure 1: Temporal Fragmentation Process

**Description of Figure 1:** This figure illustrates the temporal fragmentation process for sensitive data protection. The process begins with original data containing sensitive financial transaction information valued at $2.5M transfer. This data is processed by the Fragmentation Controller, which performs three key operations: splitting the data into 5 fragments using a 3-of-5 threshold scheme (meaning 3 fragments are required to reconstruct the original data), applying temporal constraints with a 5-minute expiry timer, and generating cryptographic time locks for each fragment. The controller outputs four individual fragments (Fragment 1, Fragment 2, Fragment 3, and Fragment 4), each containing identical security characteristics: 5-minute time locks (TimeL:5m), encrypted data using XOR-based secret sharing, and unique identifiers (001, 002, 003, 004 respectively). The critical security feature is that at T+5 minutes from creation, all fragments automatically expire and are securely deleted, ensuring that the sensitive data becomes permanently irretrievable regardless of computational capabilities available to potential attackers.

### Figure 2: Temporal Security Timeline

**Description of Figure 2:** This figure depicts the temporal security enforcement timeline demonstrating how fragments progress through distinct security phases. At T=0 (Fragment Creation), the original data is split into 5 fragments, time-lock encryption is applied with 5-minute expiry settings, fragments are distributed to secure locations, and the temporal validation network is activated. At T=0+30s (Early Access Window), fragments become available for reconstruction requiring a 3-of-5 threshold, all temporal validations are passing, and while quantum attacks are theoretically possible, they are strictly time-limited. At T=4m30s (Expiry Warning Window), a 30-second warning period begins before expiry, representing the last chance for legitimate reconstruction, with temporal validators signaling impending expiry and emergency reconstruction procedures becoming available. At T=5m00s (Automatic Fragment Expiry), cryptographic time locks expire triggering secure deletion protocols, memory is overwritten with random data using 7-pass DOD standard procedures, cryptographic keys are destroyed, and fragments become permanently irretrievable. At T=5m01s (Post-Expiry Security State), data cannot be reconstructed by any means, quantum computers cannot break expired fragments, the attack window is permanently closed, and temporal security has been successfully enforced. The system provides a security guarantee that the maximum attack window equals 5 minutes regardless of attacker computational capabilities.

### Figure 3: Distributed Temporal Validation Network

**Description of Figure 3:** This figure illustrates the distributed temporal validation network architecture for fragment freshness verification. The validation process begins with a validation request for Fragment 001 freshness check, containing Fragment ID 001, expiry time T+5min, current time T+2min, and validation hash 0xABC123. This validation request is distributed simultaneously to three geographically distributed validation nodes: Node 1 located in Singapore, Node 2 in London, and Node 3 in New York. Each node independently processes the validation request and determines fragment validity. All three nodes return positive validation results marked as VALID, indicating 3 minutes remain before fragment expiry. The distributed responses are aggregated into a consensus result showing 3 out of 3 valid responses, consensus status as FRAGMENT VALID, remaining time of 3 minutes, and confirmation that the threshold has been met (requiring 2/3 consensus for validation approval). This distributed validation network ensures that fragment freshness is verified across multiple geographic locations, providing robust temporal validation even if individual nodes fail or become compromised, while maintaining accurate time synchronization for security enforcement.

### Figure 4: Secure Fragment Expiry Process

**Description of Figure 4:** This figure demonstrates the secure fragment expiry process that occurs when temporal constraints are reached. The process is triggered when T+5min is reached, initiating Fragment 001 expiry enforcement. The secure expiry process consists of three sequential steps executed automatically. Step 1 involves cryptographic key destruction, where time-lock decryption keys are destroyed, fragment encryption keys are overwritten, key derivation parameters are cleared, and the system confirms that keys are irretrievably destroyed. Step 2 implements secure memory overwrite using the 7-Pass DOD Standard, systematically overwriting memory with seven distinct patterns: Pass 1 uses 0xFF pattern, Pass 2 uses 0x00 pattern, Pass 3 uses random data, Pass 4 uses 0xAA pattern, Pass 5 uses 0x55 pattern, Pass 6 uses random data, and Pass 7 uses random data, with each pass completing successfully. Step 3 performs comprehensive storage media clearing, where disk sectors are overwritten and deallocated, database records are purged and vacuumed, network buffers are cleared, and cache memory is flushed, confirming that all storage has been cleared. The process concludes with Fragment 001 being securely expired, data state confirmed as permanently irretrievable, and security level verified as quantum-safe. This comprehensive expiry process ensures that expired fragments cannot be recovered through any known technical means, providing absolute temporal security enforcement.
