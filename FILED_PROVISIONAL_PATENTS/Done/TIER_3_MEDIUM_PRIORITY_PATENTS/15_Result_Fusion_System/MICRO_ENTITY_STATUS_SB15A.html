        <strong>Micro entity status, once established, remains in effect until changed.</strong> Any change in status must be filed in writing in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest of the issue fee or any maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a micro entity is no longer appropriate. See 37 CFR 1.29(i). Failure to notify the Office of a change in entitlement to micro entity status and attempted payment of a micro entity fee when micro entity status is not appropriate, shall be considered to be fraud practiced or attempted on the Office. <strong>37 CFR 1.29(k)(1)</strong>
