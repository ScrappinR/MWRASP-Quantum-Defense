## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to cybersecurity threat detection systems, and more particularly to predictive systems that detect and respond to quantum computing-based attacks using machine learning analysis and automated countermeasures.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Quantum Threat Landscape

The emergence of practical quantum computers creates unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. Traditional security systems designed to detect classical attacks are inadequate for identifying quantum-based threats, which operate using fundamentally different attack vectors and capabilities.

### Problems with Existing Threat Detection

Current cybersecurity systems suffer from critical limitations in the quantum era:

1. **Classical Attack Pattern Recognition**: Existing systems are trained on classical attack patterns and cannot recognize quantum-based attack signatures
2. **Reactive Response Models**: Traditional systems respond to attacks after detection, but quantum attacks can succeed faster than classical response times
3. **Inadequate Quantum Threat Intelligence**: Current threat intelligence systems lack comprehensive understanding of quantum attack methodologies

### Need for Innovation

There exists a critical need for predictive quantum threat detection that can identify quantum attacks before they succeed and implement automated countermeasures faster than quantum attack timelines.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary Predictive Quantum Threat Detection and Response System that uses machine learning analysis, quantum threat intelligence, and automated countermeasures to detect and prevent quantum computing-based attacks before they can succeed.

### Key Innovations

**1. Quantum Attack Pattern Recognition Engine**

**2. Predictive Threat Assessment System**

**3. Automated Quantum Countermeasures**
Rapid response systems that deploy post-quantum cryptographic protections and quantum-resistant defenses automatically upon threat detection.

**4. Quantum Threat Intelligence Platform**
