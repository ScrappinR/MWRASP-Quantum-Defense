## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to self-healing network infrastructures, and more particularly to quantum-safe network systems that automatically detect, isolate, and recover from network failures and quantum computing-based attacks using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms and automated resilience protocols.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Network Resilience Challenge

Modern networks face increasingly sophisticated attacks and failures that can compromise entire network infrastructures. The emergence of quantum computing amplifies these challenges by threatening the cryptographic foundations that secure network communications and authentication systems.

### Problems with Existing Approaches

Current network resilience systems suffer from critical limitations:

1. **Quantum-Vulnerable Recovery Mechanisms**: Traditional network recovery relies on classical cryptographic systems that will be broken by quantum computers
2. **Reactive Response Models**: Existing systems respond to failures after they occur, rather than predicting and preventing them
3. **Limited Self-Healing Capabilities**: Current networks require human intervention for complex failure recovery scenarios

### Need for Innovation

There exists a critical need for self-healing network infrastructure that provides quantum-resistant resilience and automated recovery from both traditional network failures and quantum computing-based attacks.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary Self-Healing Quantum-Safe Network Infrastructure that automatically detects, isolates, and recovers from network failures and quantum attacks using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms, predictive analysis, and automated resilience protocols.

### Key Innovations

**1. Quantum-Safe Self-Healing Architecture**
Network infrastructure that automatically repairs itself using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms immune to quantum computing attacks.

**2. Predictive Network Failure Analysis**
Advanced analytics that predict network failures and quantum attacks before they occur, enabling proactive resilience measures.

**3. Automated Quantum-Resistant Recovery**
Rapid recovery systems that restore network functionality using post-quantum cryptographic protocols and quantum-safe authentication.

**4. Distributed Resilience Coordination**
Coordinated self-healing across distributed network infrastructure with quantum-resistant inter-node communication.
