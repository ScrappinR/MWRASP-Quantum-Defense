**Filing Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Application Type:** Provisional Patent Application  
**Technology Field:** Network Infrastructure, Self-Healing Systems, Post-Quantum Security

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to self-healing network infrastructures, and more particularly to quantum-safe network systems that automatically detect, isolate, and recover from network failures and quantum computing-based attacks using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms and automated resilience protocols.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Network Resilience Challenge

Modern networks face increasingly sophisticated attacks and failures that can compromise entire network infrastructures. The emergence of quantum computing amplifies these challenges by threatening the cryptographic foundations that secure network communications and authentication systems.

Traditional network resilience approaches rely on reactive responses to failures and attacks. These systems typically require human intervention for complex recovery scenarios and depend on classical cryptographic systems that will be vulnerable to quantum computers.

### Problems with Existing Network Resilience Systems

Current network resilience systems suffer from critical limitations:

**1. Quantum-Vulnerable Recovery Mechanisms**
Traditional network recovery relies on classical cryptographic systems (RSA, ECDSA, AES in classical modes) that will be broken by quantum computers using Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. This creates fundamental security vulnerabilities during network recovery operations.

**2. Reactive Response Models**
Existing systems respond to failures after they occur, rather than predicting and preventing them. This reactive approach results in:
- Extended downtime during recovery operations
- Cascading failures that spread across network infrastructure
- Security vulnerabilities during recovery transitions
- Loss of critical data and communications

**3. Limited Self-Healing Capabilities**
Current networks require human intervention for complex failure recovery scenarios, including:
- Manual configuration of backup systems
- Human validation of recovery procedures  
- Manual restoration of cryptographic key materials
- Operator-dependent coordination across distributed systems

**4. Inadequate Quantum Threat Protection**
Existing resilience systems lack protection against quantum-specific attack vectors:
- Quantum eavesdropping on recovery communications
- Quantum-enabled man-in-the-middle attacks during failover
- Quantum cryptographic attacks on backup authentication systems
- Quantum-accelerated distributed denial-of-service attacks

### Need for Innovation

There exists a critical need for self-healing network infrastructure that provides quantum-resistant resilience and automated recovery from both traditional network failures and quantum computing-based attacks.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary Self-Healing Quantum-Safe Network Infrastructure that automatically detects, isolates, and recovers from network failures and quantum attacks using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms, predictive analysis, and automated resilience protocols.

### Key Innovations

**1. Quantum-Safe Self-Healing Architecture**
Network infrastructure that automatically repairs itself using post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms immune to quantum computing attacks, including CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange, CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures, and SPHINCS+ for long-term authentication.

**2. Predictive Network Failure Analysis**
Advanced analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence that predict network failures and quantum attacks before they occur, enabling proactive resilience measures and preventing cascading failures.

**3. Automated Quantum-Resistant Recovery**
Rapid recovery systems that restore network functionality using post-quantum cryptographic protocols and quantum-safe authentication, providing sub-second failover capabilities without human intervention.

**4. Distributed Resilience Coordination**
Coordinated self-healing across distributed network infrastructure with quantum-resistant inter-node communication, enabling recovery operations that span multiple data centers and geographic locations.

**5. Quantum Attack Mitigation**
Specialized defense mechanisms against quantum-specific attack vectors, including quantum eavesdropping detection, quantum-safe communication channels, and quantum-resistant backup systems.
