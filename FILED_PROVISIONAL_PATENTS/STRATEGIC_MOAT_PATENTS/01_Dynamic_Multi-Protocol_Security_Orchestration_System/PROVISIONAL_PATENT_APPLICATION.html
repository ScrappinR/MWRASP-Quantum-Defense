<h2>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h2>

This invention relates to dynamic security orchestration systems for quantum-resistant cryptographic infrastructure, specifically to multi-protocol systems that automatically adapt security protocols based on real-time quantum threat assessment, device capabilities, and operational conditions while maintaining seamless communication across diverse computing environments.

<br/><br/>

<h2>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h2>

The emergence of quantum computing poses an unprecedented threat to current cryptographic infrastructure. Organizations must transition from quantum-vulnerable algorithms (RSA, ECC, DH) to post-quantum alternatives while maintaining operational continuity. Current limitations include:

<br/><br/>

<strong>Static Security Protocol Limitations:</strong>
- <strong>Fixed protocol selection</strong>: Cannot adapt to varying quantum threat levels or device capabilities
- <strong>Manual migration processes</strong>: Requiring extensive human intervention for protocol transitions
- <strong>Compatibility issues</strong>: Inability to maintain communication between classical and post-quantum systems
- <strong>Threat-insensitive operations</strong>: No consideration of real-time quantum computing capabilities or threat intelligence
- <strong>Resource-agnostic deployment</strong>: Same protocols regardless of device computational constraints

<br/><br/>

<strong>Need for Dynamic Quantum-Aware Security Orchestration:</strong>
Modern computing environments span from IoT devices to high-performance servers, each with different computational capabilities and security requirements. As quantum computers advance, organizations need security systems that can automatically assess quantum threats and dynamically select appropriate cryptographic protocols while maintaining interoperability across diverse systems.

<br/><br/>

<h2>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h2>

The present invention provides a Dynamic Multi-Protocol Security Orchestration System that automatically selects and deploys optimal cryptographic protocols based on real-time quantum threat assessment, device capabilities, and operational requirements while maintaining seamless interoperability across diverse computing environments.

<br/><br/>

Key innovations include:

<br/><br/>

1. <strong>Real-Time Quantum Threat Assessment Engine</strong>: Continuous monitoring of quantum computing capabilities and threat landscape
2. <strong>Dynamic Protocol Selection Algorithm</strong>: Intelligent selection of optimal cryptographic protocols based on multiple factors
3. <strong>Seamless Protocol Bridging</strong>: Transparent communication between systems using different cryptographic protocols
4. <strong>Automated Vulnerability Assessment</strong>: Real-time evaluation of cryptographic vulnerabilities and security gaps
5. <strong>Adaptive Resource Management</strong>: Optimization of cryptographic operations based on device capabilities
6. <strong>Intelligent Migration Orchestration</strong>: Coordinated transition of systems from vulnerable to quantum-safe protocols

<br/><br/>

The system provides robust, adaptive security that evolves with the quantum threat landscape while maintaining operational efficiency.
