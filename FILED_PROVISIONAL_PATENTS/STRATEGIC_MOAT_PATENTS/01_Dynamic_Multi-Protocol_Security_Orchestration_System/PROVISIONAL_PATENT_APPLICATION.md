**TITLE:** Dynamic Multi-Protocol Security Orchestration System with Real-Time Quantum Threat Assessment and Automated Algorithm Selection

**DOCKET NUMBER:** MWRASP-MOAT-001-PROV

**INVENTOR(S):** MWRASP Defense Systems

**FILED:** September 3, 2025

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to dynamic security orchestration systems for transitioning between quantum-vulnerable and quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols, specifically to automated multi-protocol security systems that continuously monitor global quantum computing capabilities and automatically adapt cryptographic implementations based on real-time threat assessment while maintaining seamless interoperability and backward compatibility.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Current cybersecurity systems face an unprecedented challenge from the advancing quantum computing threat landscape. Traditional cryptographic systems rely on mathematical assumptions that will become vulnerable to quantum attacks, yet the timeline for practical quantum computers remains uncertain, creating a critical need for adaptive security systems.

### Current Limitations in Quantum-Classical Security Transitions

**Static Security Protocol Selection:**
- **Fixed cryptographic implementations**: Cannot adapt to evolving quantum threats
- **Manual transition processes**: Require human intervention and planning
- **Binary security states**: Either quantum-vulnerable or quantum-resistant with no adaptive middle ground
- **Global deployment complexity**: Coordinating transitions across distributed systems
- **Compatibility maintenance**: Ensuring interoperability during transition periods

**Lack of Real-Time Threat Intelligence:**
- **Static threat models**: Based on theoretical timelines rather than actual capabilities
- **No continuous monitoring**: Cannot detect quantum computing breakthroughs in real-time
- **Manual assessment processes**: Human-dependent threat evaluation and response
- **Delayed response capabilities**: Weeks or months to respond to new quantum threats

**Orchestration and Management Challenges:**
- **Uncoordinated transitions**: Each system component managed independently
- **Performance optimization gaps**: No optimization during transition states
- **Rollback complexity**: Difficult to revert changes if transitions fail
- **Resource allocation issues**: Inefficient use of computational resources during transitions

### Need for Dynamic Multi-Protocol Security Orchestration

Modern organizations operate complex, distributed systems that must maintain security while adapting to rapidly evolving quantum threats. An effective solution must provide automated threat assessment, seamless protocol transitions, performance optimization, and coordinated management across all system components.

The quantum threat timeline uncertainty requires adaptive systems that can respond immediately to quantum computing breakthroughs while maintaining optimal performance and compatibility. Current approaches lack the sophistication needed for real-time threat-aware security orchestration.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a Dynamic Multi-Protocol Security Orchestration System that automatically monitors global quantum computing capabilities, assesses threats in real-time, and orchestrates seamless transitions between quantum-vulnerable and quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols while maintaining system performance and interoperability.

### Key Innovations:

1. **Real-Time Quantum Threat Intelligence Engine**: Continuous monitoring of global quantum computing capabilities with automated threat assessment
2. **Adaptive Multi-Protocol Orchestration**: Dynamic selection and coordination of cryptographic protocols based on threat levels and system requirements
3. **Seamless Transition Management**: Automated protocol transitions with performance optimization and rollback capabilities
4. **Intelligent Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource management for optimal performance during transition states
5. **Compatibility Preservation Framework**: Maintains interoperability across mixed-security environments
6. **Predictive Threat Modeling**: Anticipates quantum computing advances for proactive security adaptations

The system provides robust, adaptive security that evolves with the quantum threat landscape while maintaining optimal system performance and compatibility.
