    <!-- Summary of the Invention -->
    <div class="section-header">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</div>
    <p>The present invention revolutionizes cybersecurity by achieving true information-theoretic security through fundamental physics constraints rather than computational complexity assumptions. The system creates security through <strong>physical impossibility</strong> - an attacker would need to violate the laws of physics to compromise the system.</p>

    <div class="subsection-header">Core Innovation: Speed-of-Light Security Architecture</div>
    <p>The system distributes cryptographic fragments across precisely calculated geographic locations with temporal constraints shorter than light-speed communication delays. This creates an unbreakable security guarantee: simultaneous fragment access requires faster-than-light communication, which is physically impossible.</p>

    <div class="subsection-header">Revolutionary Security Guarantee</div>
    <div class="mathematical-proof">
        <strong>Mathematical Proof of Security:</strong>
        <br>• Fragment combination required within time T
        <br>• Light-speed communication requires time T + δ (where δ > 0)  
        <br>• Therefore: Simultaneous access is physically impossible
        <br>• Security is absolute independent of computational advances
    </div>

    <div class="subsection-header">Breakthrough Capabilities</div>

        <li><strong>Information-Theoretic Security</strong>: Absolute security regardless of computational power (classical or quantum)</li>

    <div class="abstract">
        <p>An Information-Theoretic Security System achieves absolute security through fundamental physics constraints rather than computational complexity assumptions. The system distributes cryptographic fragments across precisely calculated geographic locations using Haversine distance formulas to maximize physical separation. Atomic clock synchronization maintains microsecond-precision temporal coordination across continental distances. Speed-of-light constraint validation enforces temporal access limitations shorter than light-speed communication delays between fragment locations. AI-driven autonomous agents transport fragments securely using zero-knowledge protocols. Physics violation detection monitors for impossible simultaneous access patterns requiring faster-than-light communication. The system creates security through physical impossibility - simultaneous fragment access would violate fundamental laws of physics. This provides absolute protection against both classical and quantum computational attacks, as security depends on physics constraints rather than mathematical assumptions. Applications include critical infrastructure protection, financial systems, defense communications, and high-security environments requiring provable information-theoretic security guarantees.</p>
