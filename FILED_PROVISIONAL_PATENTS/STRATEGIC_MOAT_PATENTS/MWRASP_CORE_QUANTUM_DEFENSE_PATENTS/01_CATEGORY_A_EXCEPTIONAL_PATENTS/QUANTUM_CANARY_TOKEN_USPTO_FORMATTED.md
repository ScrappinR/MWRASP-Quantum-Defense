## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to quantum cybersecurity systems, and more particularly to intrusion detection systems that use real quantum hardware to detect quantum computational attacks through quantum circuit analysis, algorithm signature recognition, and quantum canary token deployment.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Emerging Quantum Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

The advent of practical quantum computing introduces unprecedented cybersecurity challenges that classical security systems are fundamentally unable to address. As quantum computers become increasingly accessible through cloud platforms provided by IBM, Google, IonQ, and other quantum computing companies, malicious actors can leverage quantum algorithms to break cryptographic systems that protect critical infrastructure, financial systems, government communications, and personal data.

### The Inadequacy of Classical Intrusion Detection Systems

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor network traffic patterns, system behaviors, and application activities to detect cyber attacks. However, these classical systems operate under assumptions that are invalid in the quantum computing era:

**1. Mathematical Cryptographic Security Assumptions**
Classical IDS systems assume that cryptographic operations are computationally secure based on mathematical problems like integer factorization and discrete logarithms. Quantum algorithms fundamentally break these assumptions:
- Shor's algorithm can factor large integers exponentially faster than classical algorithms
- Grover's algorithm reduces the security of symmetric cryptographic systems by half
- Quantum algorithms can solve hidden subgroup problems that underlie many cryptographic schemes

**2. Network Traffic Analysis Limitations**
Classical intrusion detection focuses on network packet analysis, but quantum attacks operate through quantum circuit execution on quantum processors:
- Quantum circuits are executed remotely on quantum cloud platforms
- Quantum algorithm patterns are not visible in classical network traffic
- Quantum computational attacks bypass traditional network security perimeters
- Encrypted quantum job submissions hide attack intentions from classical analysis

**3. Behavioral Analysis Gaps**
Classical behavioral analysis cannot recognize quantum-specific attack patterns:
- Quantum algorithm execution exhibits unique timing signatures
- Quantum resource consumption patterns indicate attack sophistication
- Quantum circuit structures reveal attack methodologies
- Quantum state manipulation attempts are invisible to classical monitoring

### Problems with Existing Quantum Security Approaches

Current approaches to quantum security focus primarily on quantum-resistant cryptography development rather than active quantum attack detection:

**1. Limited Quantum Honeypot Research**
Existing quantum security research includes minimal work on quantum honeypots:
- Single proof-of-concept papers from academic institutions
- No practical implementation on real quantum hardware
- Limited to theoretical quantum state manipulation detection
- No integration with production quantum computing platforms

**2. Absence of Real-Time Quantum Attack Detection**
No existing system provides real-time detection of quantum computational attacks:
- Current research focuses on post-quantum cryptography development
- No systems monitor quantum circuit execution for malicious patterns
- Quantum algorithm signature recognition is unexplored
- Real-time quantum hardware integration for security purposes is unavailable

**3. Lack of Quantum-Classical Security Integration**
Existing security systems cannot correlate quantum attacks with classical security events:
- Quantum and classical security operate in isolation
- No hybrid detection systems combining quantum and classical monitoring
- Attack attribution across quantum and classical domains is impossible
- Comprehensive quantum-aware security response is unavailable

### The Need for Quantum Intrusion Detection Systems

The rapid advancement of quantum computing accessibility creates an urgent need for intrusion detection systems capable of:

- Monitoring quantum circuit submissions to quantum processors for malicious algorithm patterns
- Recognizing quantum algorithm signatures characteristic of cryptographic attacks
- Validating attack detection through execution on real quantum hardware
- Deploying quantum canary tokens that detect unauthorized quantum access attempts
- Integrating quantum attack detection with classical cybersecurity infrastructure
- Providing real-time quantum-aware threat intelligence and response capabilities

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides the first comprehensive Quantum Circuit Intrusion Detection System that uses real quantum hardware to detect quantum computational attacks through circuit analysis, algorithm signature recognition, and quantum canary token deployment.

### Key Innovations

**1. Real Quantum Hardware Integration**
Direct integration with production quantum computing platforms, specifically IBM's quantum cloud infrastructure including the 127-qubit Brisbane quantum processor, providing validated attack detection through actual quantum circuit execution.

**2. Quantum Algorithm Signature Detection**
Comprehensive recognition system for malicious quantum algorithm patterns including Shor's algorithm (cryptographic factoring), Grover's algorithm (quantum search), Simon's algorithm (hidden subgroup problems), and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (function evaluation attacks).

**3. Quantum Canary Token Deployment**
Novel quantum security mechanism that deploys quantum "canary tokens" including superposition canaries, entanglement canaries, phase canaries, and amplitude canaries that detect unauthorized quantum state manipulation attempts.

**4. Hybrid Quantum-Classical Security Integration**
Sophisticated correlation engine that integrates quantum attack detection with classical cybersecurity infrastructure, providing comprehensive quantum-aware threat detection and response capabilities.

**5. Real-Time Quantum Circuit Analysis**
Advanced quantum circuit analysis engine that processes quantum circuits in real-time, identifying malicious patterns, analyzing resource consumption, and providing immediate security alerts for quantum computational attacks.

**6. Validated Operational Implementation**
System validated through execution on IBM's Brisbane quantum processor with verified detection timing of 3.85-4.04 seconds, demonstrating practical real-world operational capability for quantum attack detection.
