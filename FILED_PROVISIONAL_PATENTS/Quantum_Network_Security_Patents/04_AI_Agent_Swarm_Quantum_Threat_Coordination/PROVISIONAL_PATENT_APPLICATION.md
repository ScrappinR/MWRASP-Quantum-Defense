## FIELD OF INVENTION

This invention relates to artificial intelligence agent coordination systems, and more specifically to a novel method and system for coordinating distributed AI agent swarms through quantum-secured communication channels to provide coordinated threat response against quantum-enhanced cyberattacks using specialized agent roles and quantum-resistant coordination protocols.

## BACKGROUND

Current AI agent coordination systems rely on centralized command structures and classical communication protocols that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Existing multi-agent systems lack specialized threat response capabilities and fail to provide quantum-secured coordination channels. With the emergence of quantum-enhanced cyberattacks, there is a critical need for distributed AI agent swarms that can coordinate responses through quantum-resistant communication while maintaining operational security against quantum adversaries.

**Prior art limitations:**
- Centralized AI agent coordination creates single points of failure vulnerable to quantum attacks
- Classical communication protocols between agents are susceptible to quantum eavesdropping and manipulation
- No existing systems provide specialized AI agent roles for quantum threat response
- Current multi-agent coordination lacks quantum-secured communication channels
- Existing threat response systems fail to leverage distributed agent swarm intelligence

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary method and system for coordinating distributed AI agent swarms through quantum-secured communication channels. The system enables specialized AI agents (sentinels, hunters, guardians, analysts, deception agents) to coordinate threat responses through quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptographic protocols, creating an unbreachable coordination network resistant to quantum attacks.

**Key innovations:**
1. **Quantum-Secured Agent Coordination**: AI agents communicate through quantum-resistant channels
2. **Specialized Threat Response Roles**: Agent types optimized for specific quantum attack scenarios
3. **Distributed Swarm Intelligence**: Coordinated decision-making across distributed agent networks
4. **Real-Time Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Quantum-secured distribution of threat information
5. **Adaptive Agent Selection**: Dynamic selection of optimal agents based on threat characteristics

The system achieves unprecedented threat response capability by combining specialized AI agent expertise with quantum-secured coordination, making coordinated attacks against the system computationally and physically impossible.
