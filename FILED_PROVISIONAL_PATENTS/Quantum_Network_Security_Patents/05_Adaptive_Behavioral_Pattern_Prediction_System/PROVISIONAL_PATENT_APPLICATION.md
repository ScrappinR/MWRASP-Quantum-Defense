## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to adaptive behavioral authentication systems for artificial intelligence agents, specifically to systems that provide variable-rate behavioral pattern adaptation based on circumstantial factors with autonomous zero-out capability and predetermined rollback mechanisms.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Traditional authentication systems rely on static credentials that can be compromised through observation or theft. Behavioral authentication systems attempt to address this by using patterns of behavior, but existing systems suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Static Behavioral Patterns**: Current behavioral authentication systems use fixed patterns that do not adapt to changing circumstances
2. **Uniform Adaptation Rates**: All agents in existing systems adapt at the same rate, creating predictable patterns
3. **Vulnerable Recovery Mechanisms**: When compromised, existing systems lack secure rollback capabilities
4. **Observable Pattern Evolution**: Current systems are vulnerable to pattern analysis over time
5. **Centralized Code Management**: Existing systems rely on centralized authorities for pattern updates

These limitations make current behavioral authentication systems vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, particularly in distributed AI agent environments where agents must operate autonomously across varying circumstances.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides an adaptive behavioral pattern prediction system that addresses the limitations of prior art through several revolutionary innovations:

### Key Innovations:

**1. Variable-Rate Individual Agent Adaptation**
- Each AI agent has a unique adaptation rate derived from system start point
- Adaptation rates range from 0.1 to 0.5, ensuring unpredictable pattern evolution
- Individual rates prevent systematic pattern analysis across agent population

**2. Circumstantial Adaptation Engine**
- Real-time adaptation based on time, geographic region, job function, agent interactions, and threat level
- Contextual hash generation ensures patterns adapt to specific circumstances
- Multi-dimensional adaptation prevents single-factor compromise

**3. Autonomous Zero-Out Capability**
- Agents independently detect error thresholds and trigger rollback
- Predetermined rollback points eliminate central authority dependency
- Secure rollback to system start point prevents pattern compromise

**4. Start-Point-Only Vulnerability Window**
- System is only vulnerable during initial start moment
- All subsequent pattern evolution is predetermined but unpredictable
- Even complete system observation cannot predict next patterns without start point

**5. Distributed Agent Code Management**
- Each agent carries its own behavioral authentication codes
- Autonomous code evolution based on predetermined algorithms
- No centralized pattern distribution required

### Technical Advantages:

- **Information-Theoretic Security**: Patterns based on cryptographic derivation from secret start point
- **Adaptive Resilience**: Automatic adaptation to changing circumstances
- **Autonomous Operation**: No central authority required for pattern management
- **Compromise Recovery**: Secure zero-out and rollback capability
- **Unpredictable Evolution**: Variable rates prevent pattern prediction

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### System Architecture

The Adaptive Behavioral Pattern Prediction System comprises several interconnected components:

#### 1. Behavioral Code Structure

```python
@dataclass
class BehavioralCode:
    agent_id: str                    # Unique agent identifier
    code_generation: int             # Current pattern generation
    pattern_weights: Dict[str, float] # Behavioral pattern weights
    adaptation_rate: float           # Individual adaptation rate
    last_update: float              # Timestamp of last adaptation
    circumstances_hash: str         # Hash of current circumstances
    rollback_point: int            # Predetermined rollback identifier
```

Each agent maintains its own behavioral code containing:
- **Pattern Weights**: Multi-dimensional behavioral characteristics including memory access patterns, processing rhythms, communication styles, decision timing, and resource usage
- **Adaptation Rate**: Individual rate between 0.1-0.5 determining adaptation frequency
- **Generation Tracking**: Incremental counter for pattern evolution
- **Circumstantial Hash**: Cryptographic hash of current operational context

#### 2. Circumstantial Context Engine

```python
@dataclass
class CircumstantialContext:
    timestamp: float                 # Current time
    geographic_region: str           # Operational geographic area
    job_function: str               # Current agent role/function
    recent_interactions: List[str]   # Recent agent communications
    threat_level: float             # Current threat assessment
    network_conditions: Dict        # Network latency, bandwidth
    system_load: float              # Current system utilization
```

The context engine continuously monitors:
- **Temporal Factors**: Time-of-day, day-of-week patterns
- **Geographic Factors**: Regional network characteristics and restrictions
- **Functional Factors**: Role-specific behavioral requirements
- **Interaction Factors**: Recent communication patterns
- **Threat Factors**: Dynamic threat level assessments
- **Environmental Factors**: Network and system conditions

#### 3. Pattern Adaptation Algorithm

The system implements sophisticated pattern adaptation based on circumstantial changes:

**Base Pattern Categories:**
- Memory Access (sequential vs. random)
- Processing Rhythm (steady vs. burst)
- Communication Style (direct vs. indirect)
- Decision Timing (immediate vs. deliberate)
- Resource Usage (conservative vs. aggressive)

**Adaptation Calculation:**
```python
def _calculate_adaptation_magnitude(self, code: BehavioralCode, 
                                  context: CircumstantialContext, 
                                  trigger: AdaptationTrigger) -> float:
    base_magnitude = code.adaptation_rate
    trigger_multiplier = get_trigger_multiplier(trigger)
    time_factor = min(2.0, (context.timestamp - code.last_update) / 3600)
    return min(1.0, base_magnitude * trigger_multiplier * time_factor)
```

**Circumstantial Adaptations:**
- **Time-Based**: Business hours favor steady processing, off-hours enable burst processing
- **Geography-Based**: High-latency regions favor direct communication
- **Job-Based**: Security monitoring requires immediate decisions, analysis requires deliberation
- **Threat-Based**: High threats trigger aggressive resource usage
- **Interaction-Based**: Heavy interaction periods modify communication patterns

#### 4. Zero-Out and Rollback Mechanism

When error thresholds are exceeded or compromise is detected:

```python
def zero_out_agent(self, agent_id: str, context: CircumstantialContext, reason: str):
    # Record zero-out event
    self.zero_out_events.append((context.timestamp, agent_id, reason))
    
    # Generate rollback seed from system start point
    rollback_seed_str = f"{self.system_start_point}:{agent_id}:rollback_{rollback_point}"
    rollback_seed = int(hashlib.sha256(rollback_seed_str.encode()).hexdigest()[:16], 16)
    
    # Create new behavioral code from rollback seed
    rollback_code = generate_rollback_patterns(rollback_seed)
    
    # Reset agent to generation 0 with new rollback point
    self.agent_codes[agent_id] = rollback_code
```

**Error Thresholds:**
- Minor (15%): Monitoring initiated
- Major (25%): Forced adaptation triggered
- Critical (40%): Zero-out and rollback executed

#### 5. Prediction and Authentication

The system provides behavioral pattern prediction and authentication:

**Prediction (requires system start point):**
```python
def predict_next_behavioral_pattern(self, agent_id: str, 
                                  future_context: CircumstantialContext) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # Simulate adaptation that would occur
    simulated_patterns = self._generate_adapted_patterns(current_code, future_context, magnitude)
    return flatten_patterns(simulated_patterns)
```

**Authentication:**
```python
def authenticate_agent_behavior(self, agent_id: str, observed_behavior: Dict[str, float], 
                              context: CircumstantialContext) -> Tuple[bool, float]:
    expected_pattern = get_expected_pattern(agent_id)
    similarity = calculate_behavioral_similarity(expected_pattern, observed_behavior)
    return similarity >= tolerance, similarity
```

### Security Properties

#### 1. Information-Theoretic Security Foundation

The system derives security from a single secret start point:
- All agent patterns cryptographically derived from start point
- Pattern evolution is deterministic but unpredictable without start point
- Compromise of individual patterns does not compromise system start point

#### 2. Start-Point-Only Vulnerability

The system is only vulnerable during the initial moment when the start point is used:
- After initialization, all patterns evolve deterministically
- Even complete system observation cannot predict future patterns
- Observer requires system start point for pattern prediction

#### 3. Autonomous Security Properties

Each agent operates independently:
- No centralized pattern distribution required
- Agents detect their own compromise through error thresholds
- Autonomous rollback prevents cascade failures

#### 4. Adaptive Resistance

The system automatically adapts to attacks:
- Circumstantial adaptation makes pattern observation difficult
- Variable adaptation rates prevent systematic analysis
- Zero-out capability provides immediate compromise recovery

### Implementation Examples

#### Example 1: Time-Based Adaptation

Agent operating during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM):
```
Memory Access: sequential=0.75, random=0.25  (more structured)
Processing Rhythm: steady=0.80, burst=0.20    (consistent load)
Decision Timing: deliberate=0.70, immediate=0.30 (careful decisions)
```

Same agent during off-hours:
```
Memory Access: sequential=0.60, random=0.40  (more flexible)
Processing Rhythm: steady=0.45, burst=0.55    (opportunistic bursts)
Decision Timing: immediate=0.60, deliberate=0.40 (faster response)
```

#### Example 2: Threat-Level Adaptation

Normal threat level (0.2):
```
Resource Usage: conservative=0.70, aggressive=0.30
Communication: indirect=0.60, direct=0.40
```

High threat level (0.8):
```
Resource Usage: aggressive=0.85, conservative=0.15  (performance priority)
Communication: direct=0.80, indirect=0.20         (efficiency priority)
```

#### Example 3: Zero-Out Scenario

Agent experiences 45% authentication failure rate:
1. Critical threshold exceeded (40%)
2. Zero-out triggered automatically
3. Agent rolls back to predetermined rollback point
4. New patterns generated from system start point + rollback seed
5. Agent continues operation with generation 0 patterns
