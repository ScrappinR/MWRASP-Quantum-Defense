## FIELD OF INVENTION

This invention relates to network security architectures, and more specifically to a novel hybrid system that combines quantum key distribution, post-quantum cryptography, and classical network protocols in a unified architecture that provides multiple independent layers of quantum-resistant security with automatic failover and redundancy capabilities.

## BACKGROUND

Current network security systems rely on single-layer protection that creates single points of failure vulnerable to advanced quantum attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems provide information-theoretic security but require specialized hardware and are limited by distance. Post-quantum cryptographic systems provide computational security but may be vulnerable to future quantum algorithm breakthroughs. No existing systems integrate multiple quantum-resistant technologies in a unified architecture with intelligent switching and redundancy.

**Prior art limitations:**
- Single-layer network security creates vulnerability to coordinated quantum attacks
- QKD systems limited by distance and hardware requirements without classical backup
- Post-quantum cryptography lacks information-theoretic security guarantees
- No existing integration of multiple quantum-resistant protocols with intelligent switching
- Current systems fail to provide redundant quantum-resistant security layers

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary hybrid quantum-classical network security architecture that integrates multiple independent quantum-resistant security layers. The system combines Quantum Key Distribution for information-theoretic security, post-quantum cryptography for computational security, and intelligent protocol switching to ensure continuous protection even if individual layers are compromised.

**Key innovations:**
1. **Multi-Layer Quantum Security Integration**: Combining QKD, post-quantum crypto, and classical security
2. **Intelligent Protocol Switching**: Automatic selection of optimal security protocols based on conditions
3. **Redundant Key Generation**: Multiple independent key generation systems with cross-validation
4. **Hybrid Session Key Derivation**: Combining quantum and classical keys for enhanced security
5. **Real-Time Security Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of all security layers with automatic adaptation

The system achieves unprecedented network security by ensuring that quantum attacks must simultaneously compromise multiple independent security layers, making successful attacks statistically impossible.
