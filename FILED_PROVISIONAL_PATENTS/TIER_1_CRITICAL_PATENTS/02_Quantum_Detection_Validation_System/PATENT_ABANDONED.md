# PATENT ABANDONED

**Patent 02: Quantum Detection and Validation System**

**Status**: ABANDONED - DO NOT FILE

**Date**: August 28, 2025

**Reason for Abandonment**: High prior art conflicts identified in comprehensive prior art analysis

**Specific Conflicts**:
- US11218300B1: Direct conflict with quantum algorithm threat detection
- Extensive prior art in quantum threat assessment systems
- IBM quantum hardware integration already covered in academic literature

**Recommendation**: Do not proceed with filing this patent application due to substantial risk of rejection based on anticipation and obviousness grounds.

**Prior Art Analysis**: See COMPREHENSIVE_PRIOR_ART_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md for detailed analysis.

**Alternative Strategy**: Consider filing continuation-in-part applications focused on truly novel IBM-specific integration aspects if developed in future.
