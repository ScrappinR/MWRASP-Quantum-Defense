## TECHNICAL FIELD

This invention relates to cybersecurity systems that utilize temporal constraints and speed-of-light physical limitations to achieve information-theoretic security against quantum computing attacks, specifically through time-limited data fragmentation with automatic expiry mechanisms that create physically impossible attack scenarios.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Current State of Cybersecurity

Traditional cybersecurity systems rely on mathematical cryptographic assumptions (e.g., RSA, ECC) that are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks using Shor's algorithm. Current post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards still rely on mathematical assumptions that may be broken by future quantum algorithms.

### Problem Statement

1. **Quantum Threat**: Quantum computers can break all current public-key cryptography using Shor's algorithm
2. **Mathematical Vulnerability**: All current security systems rely on mathematical assumptions that may be compromised
3. **Time Limitations**: Traditional systems have no temporal protection against prolonged quantum attacks
4. **Attack Window Vulnerability**: Existing systems provide unlimited time for quantum computers to attempt attacks

### Prior Art Limitations

**Existing Temporal Security Approaches:**
- **US8812875B1**: Virtual self-destruction through key deletion but no speed-of-light validation
- **US7904573B1**: Temporal access control but no physical impossibility constraints
- **WO2019069103A1**: Physical impossibility via quantum uncertainty but no temporal integration

**Gap in Prior Art**: No existing system combines temporal constraints with speed-of-light physical validation to create quantum-immune security architectures.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a **Temporal Constraint-Based Quantum-Safe Security Architecture** that achieves information-theoretic security through time-limited data fragments combined with speed-of-light physical validation. The system creates security windows so brief that quantum computers cannot physically overcome the temporal and geographic constraints, making successful attacks physically impossible.

### Key Innovation Elements

1. **Temporal Security Engine**: Creates time-limited security windows with automatic fragment expiry
2. **Speed-of-Light Validation**: Uses fundamental physics to validate security constraints
3. **Temporal Attack Prevention**: Prevents extended quantum algorithm execution against fragments
4. **Dynamic Temporal Adaptation**: Adjusts time constraints based on threat assessment and distance calculations

### Technical Advantages

- **Physics-Based Security**: Relies on speed of light, not mathematical assumptions
- **Quantum Attack Prevention**: Time constraints prevent prolonged quantum algorithm execution
- **Adaptive Temporal Security**: Dynamic adjustment of time windows based on threat levels
- **Physical Validation**: Hardware validation of temporal constraint compliance

5. **Dynamic Temporal Controller** - Adapts time constraints based on threat assessment
