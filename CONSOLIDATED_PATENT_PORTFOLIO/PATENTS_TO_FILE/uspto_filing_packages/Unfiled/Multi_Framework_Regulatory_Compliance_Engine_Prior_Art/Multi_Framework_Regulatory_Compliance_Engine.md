## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to enterprise security governance systems, specifically to a comprehensive multi-framework regulatory compliance engine that coordinates and manages compliance across multiple regulatory standards including FedRAMP, CMMC, SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA simultaneously.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Modern enterprises face an increasingly complex regulatory landscape with multiple overlapping compliance requirements. Organizations must simultaneously comply with:

- **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** - 421 security controls across 17 families for government cloud authorization
- **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** - 110 practices across 14 domains for defense contractors
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)** - Financial reporting and internal controls for public companies
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - Data privacy requirements for European operations
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** - Healthcare data protection requirements

Current compliance management systems suffer from significant limitations:

1. **Framework Isolation:** Each regulatory framework requires separate systems and assessments
2. **Manual Processes:** Compliance assessments rely heavily on manual documentation and review
3. **Point-in-Time Assessment:** Traditional compliance is assessed periodically rather than continuously
4. **Resource Intensive:** Multiple frameworks require duplicated effort and separate expertise
5. **Integration Challenges:** No unified view across multiple regulatory requirements
6. **Audit Burden:** Each framework requires separate audit trails and evidence collection

There is a critical need for an integrated compliance engine that provides unified management across multiple regulatory frameworks with real-time monitoring and automated assessment capabilities.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a revolutionary multi-framework regulatory compliance engine that unifies compliance management across multiple regulatory standards through intelligent control mapping, automated assessment workflows, and real-time continuous monitoring.

Key innovations include:

1. **Unified Control Architecture:** Single system managing 421 FedRAMP controls, 110 CMMC practices, and additional regulatory requirements
2. **Intelligent Control Mapping:** Automated identification of overlapping requirements across frameworks
3. **Real-Time Compliance Monitoring:** Continuous assessment and validation of security controls
4. **Automated Evidence Collection:** Systematic gathering and validation of compliance artifacts
5. **Multi-Framework Reporting:** Integrated reporting across all regulatory frameworks
6. **Predictive Compliance Analytics:** AI-driven risk assessment and compliance forecasting

The system provides enterprise-grade compliance management with 95%+ automation levels and real-time regulatory readiness assessment.
