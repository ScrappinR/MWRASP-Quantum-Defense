## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity applications, and more particularly to adaptive decision tree systems that optimize the routing of cyber threat analysis between quantum and classical computing resources based on real-time threat characteristics and system performance metrics.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Current State of Cybersecurity Decision Systems

Modern cybersecurity systems rely on predetermined rules and static decision criteria to determine how cyber threats should be analyzed and processed. These systems typically use fixed algorithms that route all similar threat types through identical processing pipelines, regardless of current system capacity, threat urgency, or analysis complexity requirements.

Current cybersecurity decision systems suffer from several fundamental limitations:

1. **Static Resource Allocation**: Traditional systems use fixed routing rules that do not adapt to changing system conditions or threat landscapes.

2. **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Without intelligent routing, systems either over-provision computational resources (leading to waste) or under-provision (leading to missed threats).

3. **Lack of Learning Capability**: Existing decision systems do not learn from historical performance to improve future routing decisions.

4. **Single-Architecture Bias**: Current systems are designed for purely classical computing architectures and cannot effectively utilize quantum computing resources.

### Limitations of Current Machine Learning Approaches

While some cybersecurity systems incorporate machine learning for threat detection, these approaches have significant limitations when applied to resource allocation and threat routing:

**Limited Adaptability**: Current ML systems in cybersecurity focus on threat classification rather than optimal resource allocation for threat analysis.

**Performance Blind Spots**: Existing systems do not consider the computational efficiency and accuracy trade-offs between different processing approaches.

**Quantum-Classical Integration Gap**: No existing systems provide intelligent decision-making for hybrid quantum-classical cybersecurity architectures.

### Need for Adaptive Decision Systems

The emergence of quantum computing in cybersecurity creates new opportunities for enhanced threat analysis, but also introduces complex resource allocation challenges:

1. **Multi-Modal Processing**: Different types of cyber threats benefit from different computational approaches (quantum vs. classical).

2. **Dynamic Optimization**: Optimal resource allocation changes based on current system load, threat characteristics, and available computational resources.

3. **Real-Time Decision Requirements**: Cybersecurity applications require microsecond-level decision making that traditional rule-based systems cannot provide.

4. **Continuous Learning**: The evolving threat landscape requires systems that continuously learn and adapt their decision-making strategies.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides adaptive decision tree systems specifically designed for quantum-enhanced cybersecurity applications. The system implements machine learning algorithms that continuously optimize the routing of cyber threat analysis between quantum and classical computing resources based on real-time threat characteristics, system performance metrics, and historical analysis outcomes.
