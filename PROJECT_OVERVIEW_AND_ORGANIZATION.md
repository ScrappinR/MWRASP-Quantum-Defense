## File Organization Recommendations

### For GitHub Public Repository:
- Include: Core system code, documentation, business materials
- Exclude: Detailed patent specifications (keep in private repo)
- Include: Patent portfolio overview and filing status

### For Private Patent Repository:
- Include: Complete patent specifications
- Include: Filing packages and USPTO materials
- Include: Patent strategy and analysis documents

This organization provides clear separation between public development materials and confidential intellectual property while maintaining project coherence and professional presentation.
