## The Challenge

In late 2023, our client's threat intelligence team detected anomalous patterns in their high-frequency trading systems. Analysis revealed signatures consistent with quantum computing attacks attempting to predict market movements by breaking encrypted order flow data.

"We were seeing impossible things," recalls the CISO. "Attackers were anticipating our trades with accuracy that defied classical computing capabilities. Our traditional encryption was failing against what we suspected were quantum computers."

### Specific Threats Identified:
- **Quantum arbitrage attacks** on dark pool transactions
- **Predictive analysis** of encrypted order books
- **Time-manipulation attempts** on trading timestamps
- **State-sponsored industrial espionage** targeting M&A data

### Business Impact:
- **$2.3M daily** in suspicious trading losses
- **Regulatory scrutiny** from SEC and international bodies
- **Client confidence** erosion with institutional investors
- **Competitive disadvantage** against quantum-equipped adversaries

## The Solution

MWRASP deployed its complete Quantum Defense Platform across the client's global infrastructure in a phased 30-day implementation.
