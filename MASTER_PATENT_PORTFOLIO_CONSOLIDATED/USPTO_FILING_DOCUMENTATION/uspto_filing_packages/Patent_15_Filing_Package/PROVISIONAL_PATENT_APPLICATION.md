**Title**: Quantum-Classical Result Fusion Algorithms

**Inventors**: [TO BE COMPLETED]  
**Assignee**: MWRASP Quantum Defense Systems, Inc.  
**Attorney Docket No**: RUTHERFORD-035-PROV

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to quantum computing systems for cybersecurity applications, and more particularly to quantum-classical result fusion algorithms systems and methods.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, organizations increasingly deploy hybrid quantum-classical analysis systems to leverage the computational advantages of quantum algorithms while maintaining the reliability and maturity of classical processing methods. However, existing approaches for combining results from quantum and classical cybersecurity analysis suffer from significant limitations.

### Problems with Existing Solutions

**Correlation Accuracy Limitations**: Current fusion methods typically employ simple averaging or weighted voting schemes that fail to account for the fundamental differences between quantum probabilistic results and deterministic classical outputs, leading to suboptimal correlation accuracy rates of 60-70%.

**Real-Time Processing Constraints**: Existing fusion algorithms require 500-2000ms for result correlation, creating unacceptable delays for time-critical threat detection where sub-100ms response times are essential for effective quantum-era attack mitigation.

**Quantum State Information Loss**: Traditional fusion approaches discard quantum-specific metadata such as entanglement measures, coherence metrics, and quantum error rates that are crucial for understanding the reliability and context of quantum analysis results.

**Scalability Bottlenecks**: Current systems experience exponential performance degradation when processing more than 50-100 concurrent quantum-classical result pairs, limiting deployment in enterprise environments requiring thousands of simultaneous analyses.

**Lack of Adaptive Learning**: Existing solutions use static fusion parameters that cannot adapt to changing threat landscapes, quantum hardware characteristics, or evolving attack patterns, resulting in degraded performance over time.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### System Architecture Overview

The quantum-classical result fusion system comprises five primary architectural components working in concert to provide comprehensive fusion capabilities:

**1. Quantum Data Preprocessing Engine**: Extracts and normalizes quantum-specific features including entanglement measures, coherence metrics, and quantum state information for fusion processing.

**2. Multi-Dimensional Correlation Engine**: Performs simultaneous correlation analysis across temporal, spatial, quantum entanglement, and behavioral dimensions to identify relationships between quantum and classical analysis results.

**3. Quantum-Aware Confidence Fusion Module**: Combines confidence scores from quantum and classical analyses using quantum-specific weighting algorithms that account for quantum error rates and measurement uncertainties.

**4. Adaptive Learning Orchestrator**: Continuously learns from fusion results to optimize correlation parameters, confidence weighting, and fusion strategies based on threat landscape evolution and system performance metrics.

**5. Enterprise Integration Layer**: Provides standardized APIs, monitoring capabilities, and integration interfaces for deployment in existing cybersecurity infrastructure.

### Quantum Data Preprocessing Engine

**Technical Implementation**: The preprocessing engine implements quantum feature extraction algorithms specifically designed for cybersecurity data fusion applications:

```
QuantumDataPreprocessor {
  preprocessing_algorithms: {
    quantum_feature_mapping: quantum state vector analysis
    quantum_noise_reduction: decoherence correction algorithms
    quantum_dimensionality_reduction: quantum PCA methods
    quantum_data_normalization: quantum probability normalization
  }
  
  async preprocess_data_batch(data_points) {
    1. Group data by source type (quantum_sensors, network_monitoring, threat_hunting)
    2. Apply source-specific preprocessing algorithms
    3. Extract quantum features:
       - entanglement_entropy = calculate_entanglement_entropy(quantum_state)
       - quantum_coherence = calculate_quantum_coherence(coherence_time)
       - circuit_complexity = analyze_quantum_circuit_depth(circuit_data)
    4. Apply quantum noise reduction for quality_score < 0.8
    5. Generate quantum-enhanced feature vectors
    6. Return preprocessed data with quantum metadata
  }
}
```

**Quantum Feature Extraction**: The system extracts specific quantum features crucial for fusion analysis:

- **Entanglement Entropy**: Calculated as S = -Tr(ρ log ρ) where ρ is the reduced density matrix, providing measure of quantum correlation strength
- **Quantum Coherence**: Measured as C = ||ρ - ρ_diag||₁ where ρ_diag contains only diagonal elements, indicating quantum superposition preservation
