## PATENT APPLICATION HEADER

**Title**: Real-Time Quantum Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Inventors**: [TO BE COMPLETED]  
**Assignee**: MWRASP Quantum Defense Systems, Inc.  
**Attorney Docket No**: RUTHERFORD-037-PROV  

---

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to quantum computing systems for cybersecurity applications, and more particularly to real-time quantum cost-benefit analysis systems and methods.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As organizations invest billions of dollars in quantum-enhanced cybersecurity infrastructure, they face critical challenges in accurately measuring return on investment (ROI), optimizing resource allocation, and justifying quantum computing expenses. Existing cost-benefit analysis systems were designed for classical computing environments and cannot accurately assess the unique economic characteristics, performance benefits, and cost structures of quantum cybersecurity deployments.

### Problems with Existing Solutions

**Quantum ROI Assessment Limitations**: Traditional IT cost-benefit analysis tools cannot accurately measure quantum cybersecurity ROI due to inability to quantify quantum advantage, quantum error correction costs, and quantum coherence preservation expenses, leading to ROI calculation errors of 40-70%.

**Real-Time Cost Tracking Gaps**: Current financial tracking systems require 24-72 hours to calculate cybersecurity investment returns, creating unacceptable delays for quantum resource optimization where sub-second cost analysis is essential for efficient resource allocation decisions.

**Quantum Resource Cost Modeling Deficiencies**: Existing systems cannot model quantum-specific cost factors including quantum gate operation costs, coherence time expenses, quantum error correction overhead, and QPU utilization efficiency, resulting in cost estimation errors exceeding 50%.

**Performance-Cost Correlation Failures**: Traditional analysis tools cannot correlate quantum cybersecurity performance improvements with associated costs, making it impossible to optimize performance-per-dollar metrics or identify cost-effective quantum security configurations.

**Enterprise Scale Limitations**: Current cost-benefit analysis platforms cannot handle the complexity of enterprise-scale quantum deployments involving hundreds of quantum operations, multiple QPU types, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows simultaneously.

**Dynamic Optimization Absence**: Existing solutions use static cost models that cannot adapt to changing quantum hardware costs, performance improvements, or evolving threat landscapes, resulting in outdated cost-benefit calculations within 30-60 days.
