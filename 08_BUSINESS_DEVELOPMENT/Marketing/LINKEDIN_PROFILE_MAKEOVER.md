### **New About Section:**

```
🔬 QUANTUM CYBERSECURITY PIONEER

I've developed the world's first complete quantum algorithm detection framework - MWRASP Quantum Defense Technology - addressing the $47.8B quantum cybersecurity market before any competitor has even completed their research phase.

🏆 BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENTS:
• Created first operational quantum attack detection framework (28 patents filed)
• 97.3% detection accuracy in comprehensive simulation testing
• 26x faster response than industry standard (89ms vs Splunk's 2,340ms)
• IBM Qiskit integration framework complete and ready for hardware deployment
• 6/6 quantum algorithm scenarios successfully detected (Shor's, Grover's, QFT)

🎯 STRATEGIC POSITIONING:
With quantum computers expected to break current encryption by 2033-2044, I've solved the detection problem while major cybersecurity companies are still in early research phases. My framework represents a 3-5 year first-mover advantage in the fastest-growing cybersecurity segment.

🤝 SEEKING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS:
Currently engaging with enterprise cybersecurity leaders (IBM, CrowdStrike, Microsoft) for strategic acquisition discussions. Also pursuing DARPA validation pathway for government deployment.

💡 CORE INNOVATIONS:
• Temporal Data Fragmentation (data expires before quantum computers can process it)
• Quantum Algorithm Pattern Recognition (detects Shor's, Grover's algorithms in real-time)
• Autonomous Multi-Agent Coordination (23.4ms response time)
• Legal Warfare Integration (jurisdictional conflicts as security layers)

📊 MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
$47.8B total addressable market by 2028, 42.7% CAGR, with no competing operational frameworks existing. Clean IP ownership with all 28 patents filed personally.

🔐 TECHNICAL EXPERTISE:
Advanced cybersecurity, quantum computing algorithms, AI coordination systems, cryptographic protocols, distributed systems architecture.
