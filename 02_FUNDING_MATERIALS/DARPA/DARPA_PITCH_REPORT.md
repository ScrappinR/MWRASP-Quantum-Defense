# 1. Problem Statement

## 1.1 The Quantum Threat Landscape

### Current Vulnerabilities
- **RSA-2048 Factorization**: Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm with ~4,000 logical qubits
- **AES-128 Key Search**: Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later**: Adversaries collecting encrypted data for future quantum decryption
- **Timeline**: IBM projects 1,000+ qubit systems by 2025, 100,000 by 2033

### Traditional Defense Limitations
| Traditional Systems | Response Time | Detection Rate | Quantum Ready |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| SIEM Platforms | 5-30 minutes | 70-85% | No |
| IDS/IPS | 1-10 seconds | 80-90% | No |
| Human SOC Teams | 15-60 minutes | 60-75% | No |
| **MWRASP** | **0.1ms auth, 63-78ms coord** | **Working System** | **Yes** |

### The Protection Gap
Current cybersecurity infrastructure lacks:
1. **Quantum-resistant cryptography** at scale
2. **Sub-second response** to quantum-speed attacks
3. **Autonomous coordination** for distributed threats
4. **Predictive capabilities** for emerging quantum attack vectors

*"For thousands of years, castles were humanity's ultimate defense against outside forces. When gunpowder and cannons emerged, the instinct was to build thicker walls - but this only delayed the inevitable if attackers had enough explosives. True security came when defense evolved from concentrated strongholds to distributed, adaptive networks. In the quantum age, we face the same paradigm shift. Traditional cybersecurity builds thicker digital walls, but quantum computers will eventually break through any static defense. MWRASP represents the evolution to distributed, intelligent defense - thinking faster than quantum attacks can execute through the fusion of quantum physics, artificial intelligence, and human ingenuity."*
