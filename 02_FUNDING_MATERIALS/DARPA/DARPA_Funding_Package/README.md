## Package Overview

This folder contains the complete DARPA funding package for the Multi-Wavelength Rapid-Aging Surveillance Platform (MWRASP) Complete Unified Defense System. The package provides comprehensive documentation for government evaluation and funding consideration.

### Executive Summary

MWRASP is a TRL 3-4 quantum cybersecurity prototype that directly addresses DARPA's three critical 2025 cybersecurity pain points:
1. **Operational Readiness Gap** - 18-24 month pathway to operational deployment vs. 5-7 years for competing approaches
2. **Scaling and Automation Crisis** - Fully autonomous millisecond response with zero human intervention required
3. **Quantum Timeline Uncertainty** - Quantum-independent defense operational today regardless of quantum computing timeline

### Funding Request: $12.5M over 42 months
