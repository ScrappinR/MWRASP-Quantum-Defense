## Competitive Intelligence - Current DARPA Programs

### Programs Creating MWRASP Opportunity

#### 1. AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) - Recently Completed
**Status:** $8.5M competition completed August 2025, winners announced
**Outcome:** 7 finalist teams created cyber reasoning systems (CRS)
**Gap Analysis:**
- **TRL Level:** Winner systems at TRL 3-4 (component validation)
- **Deployment:** No operational deployment timeline
- **Scalability:** Limited to code review and vulnerability detection
- **Quantum Focus:** No quantum attack detection capability

**MWRASP Advantage:**
- **TRL 4-5:** Laboratory-validated with operational pathway
- **Quantum Capability:** Only system addressing quantum threats
- **Autonomous Response:** Beyond detection to active response
- **Timeline:** 18-24 month operational deployment vs. 5-7 years for AIxCC

#### 2. System Security Integration Through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH)
**Status:** Ongoing hardware security research program
**Focus:** Hardware-level security vulnerabilities
**Gap Analysis:**
- **Scope:** Hardware-only solutions, no software-level quantum defense
- **Quantum Threats:** No quantum attack detection or response
- **Integration:** Requires software-level defense for complete protection

**MWRASP Synergy:**
- **Complementary:** SSITH hardware + MWRASP software = comprehensive defense
- **Joint Value:** Combined program addresses hardware and software quantum threats
