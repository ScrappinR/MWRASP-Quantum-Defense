## **PRESENTATION DELIVERY NOTES**

### **Opening (Strong Hook):**
*"What if I told you that every encryption key protecting your most sensitive data could be broken in hours by a quantum computer that exists today? And what if I told you we have the only system in the world that can detect and stop these attacks in real-time?"*

### **Key Message Reinforcement:**
- Repeat "First operational quantum threat detection system" 3 times
- Emphasize "Proven on real IBM quantum hardware" throughout
- Stress "Mathematical impossibility" of attacks succeeding

### **Handling Objections:**
- **"Too early for quantum threats"** → Show IBM Brisbane results, accelerated timeline
- **"Too expensive"** → Show ROI calculations, breach cost comparison
- **"Unproven technology"** → Display real quantum execution results
- **"Integration complexity"** → Demonstrate API compatibility, deployment speed

### **Closing Strong:**
*"You have a choice: Wait for the first quantum cyberattack to make headlines, or be protected from day one. MWRASP is ready now. Are you?"*
