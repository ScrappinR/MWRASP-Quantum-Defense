### **🛡️ TECHNICAL DIFFERENTIATION**

**vs. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):**
- MWRASP **includes** PQC + adds temporal protection + real-time detection
- Active defense vs. passive resistance
- Protection continues even if future cryptanalysis breaks PQC

**vs. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):**
- No specialized quantum hardware required
- Protects all data types, not just key exchange
- Software solution vs. expensive quantum infrastructure

**vs. Traditional Cybersecurity:**
- Can detect quantum algorithm execution (no existing system can do this)
- Mathematical security guarantee vs. computational difficulty
- Sub-second response vs. hours/days for traditional incident response
