```python
class CoreSystemROI:
    def __init__(self, acquisition_cost, market_opportunity):
        self.acquisition_cost = acquisition_cost  # $100-200M range
        self.market_opportunity = market_opportunity  # Quantum security TAM
        
    def calculate_5year_roi(self):
        """Calculate 5-year ROI for core quantum detection system"""
        
        # Revenue streams from core system
        licensing_revenue = [15, 40, 75, 120, 180]  # Millions, Years 1-5
        service_revenue = [5, 15, 30, 50, 70]      # Professional services

        total_revenue = sum(licensing_revenue + service_revenue + premium_pricing)
        # Total: $540M over 5 years
        
        # Costs
        integration_costs = 20  # M, one-time
        ongoing_development = 50  # M over 5 years
        total_costs = integration_costs + ongoing_development
        
        net_benefit = total_revenue - total_costs - self.acquisition_cost
        roi_percentage = (net_benefit / self.acquisition_cost) * 100
        
        return {
            'total_revenue': total_revenue,
            'total_costs': total_costs + self.acquisition_cost,
            'net_benefit': net_benefit,
