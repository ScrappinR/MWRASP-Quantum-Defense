- Operational prototype development and hardening</p>
<p><strong>Success Metrics for Phase I:</strong>
- Independent security assessment rating &gt;7/10
- Government system compatibility &gt;80%
- Quantum attack detection accuracy &gt;85% against real quantum computers
- Government stakeholder approval for Phase II continuation</p>
<p><strong>Phase II Continuation:</strong> Based on successful Phase I validation results
- Advanced capability development and optimization
- Full government deployment preparation
- Operational transition and government capability delivery</p>
<p>This honest approach provides DARPA with realistic expectations and a credible path to operational quantum cybersecurity capability while maintaining integrity and transparency throughout the development process.</p>
