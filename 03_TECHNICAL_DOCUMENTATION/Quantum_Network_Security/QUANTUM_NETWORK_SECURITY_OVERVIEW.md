        """Generate quantum-secure protocol sequence"""
        if threat_level > 0.5:
            return self.apply_quantum_decoherence(base_sequence)
        elif threat_level > 0.2:
            return self.apply_quantum_superposition(base_sequence)
        else:
            return self.apply_quantum_coherence(base_sequence)

        """Establish connection using optimal hybrid security protocols"""
        # Establish QKD layer for information-theoretic security
        # Deploy post-quantum layer for computational backup
        # Combine keys from multiple layers for enhanced security
        # Provide automatic failover between security layers
```

**Key Features**:
- Combines Quantum Key Distribution with post-quantum cryptography
- Intelligent protocol selection based on network conditions and threats
- Hybrid key combination requiring compromise of multiple security layers
- Automatic failover ensuring continuous protection during layer failures

### 4. AI Agent Swarm Quantum Threat Coordination

**Innovation**: Quantum-secured coordination of specialized AI agent swarms

```python
class AIAgentQuantumCoordination:
    def coordinate_quantum_swarm_response(self, threat_type: str, threat_data: dict):
        """Coordinate quantum-secured swarm response to threats"""
        # Select specialized agents based on threat characteristics
        # Establish quantum coordination channels between agents
        # Distribute threat intelligence through quantum-authenticated channels
        # Execute coordinated response across distributed agent network
```

**Key Features**:
- Quantum-secured communication between distributed AI agents
- Specialized agent roles (sentinel, hunter, guardian, analyst, deception)
- Real-time threat intelligence sharing through quantum channels
- Dynamic agent selection optimizing threat response effectiveness
