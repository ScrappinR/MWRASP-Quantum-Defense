                    CERTIFICATION OF MICRO ENTITY STATUS
                         (GROSS INCOME BASIS)

Application Number: To be assigned
Filing Date: [DATE]
First Named Inventor: Brian James Rutherford
Title: TEMPORAL DATA FRAGMENTATION WITH MILLISECOND EXPIRATION FOR QUANTUM ATTACK 
       MITIGATION

Attorney Docket Number: RUTHERFORD-027-PROV

I hereby certify that:

(1) I qualify as a micro entity as defined in 37 CFR 1.29(a) because I am an applicant 
    who is an inventor or joint inventor.

(2) I have not been named as an inventor on more than four previously filed patent 
    applications, excluding:
    • Applications filed in another country;
    • Provisional applications under 35 U.S.C. 111(b); and
    • International applications for which the basic national fee under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) 
      was not paid.

(3) I have not, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the examination 
    fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal 
    Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for that 
    preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census 
    (currently $212,300 for 2024).

(4) I have not assigned, granted, or conveyed, and am not under obligation by contract 
    or law to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the 
    application concerned to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar 
    year in which the examination fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in 
    section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median 
    household income for that preceding calendar year.

I acknowledge the duty to file, in this application or patent, notification of any change 
in status resulting in the loss of entitlement to micro entity status prior to paying, or 
at the time of paying, the lowest amount of a fee due at the time the fee is paid.

I hereby acknowledge that any willful false statement made in this certification is 
punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001 by fine or imprisonment of not more than five (5) years, 
or both.
