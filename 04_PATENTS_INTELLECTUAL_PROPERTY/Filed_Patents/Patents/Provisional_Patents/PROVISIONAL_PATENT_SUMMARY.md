## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Strengths:
1. **System Integration Patent** - Completely novel, no prior art
2. **Legal Barriers** - Unique defensive approach
3. **Agent Evolution** - First in cybersecurity context
4. **Temporal Fragmentation** - Strong technical innovation

### Risks:
1. **Digital Body Language** - Overlaps with keystroke dynamics
2. **Quantum Canary Tokens** - Similar to quantum honeypots
3. **Geographic-Temporal** - Components exist separately

### Recommendations:
1. File patents 1-4 immediately (highest value, lowest risk)
2. Refine claims for patents 5-6 before filing
3. Consider defensive publication for patent 7
