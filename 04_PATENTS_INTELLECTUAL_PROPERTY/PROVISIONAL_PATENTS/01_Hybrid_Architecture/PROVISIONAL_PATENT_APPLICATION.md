## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to cybersecurity systems and methods, and more particularly to hybrid quantum-classical computing architectures for real-time threat detection and response in enterprise cybersecurity environments.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Current State of Cybersecurity

Traditional cybersecurity systems rely entirely on classical computing architectures to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats. These systems typically operate using predefined rules, signature-based detection, and statistical analysis methods that require significant computational resources and time to process complex threat patterns.

Current cybersecurity architectures suffer from several fundamental limitations:

1. **Processing Speed Limitations**: Classical systems require seconds to minutes to analyze complex threat patterns, during which sophisticated attacks can complete their objectives.

2. **Pattern Recognition Constraints**: Classical algorithms struggle with the exponential complexity of modern multi-vector cyber attacks that use advanced obfuscation and polymorphic techniques.

3. **Resource Allocation Inefficiencies**: Current systems cannot dynamically allocate computational resources based on threat complexity and urgency, leading to either over-provisioning (wasting resources) or under-provisioning (missing threats).

4. **Scalability Issues**: As cyber threats become more sophisticated and numerous, classical systems require exponentially more computational resources to maintain detection accuracy.

### Emergence of Quantum Computing Threats

The advent of practical quantum computing presents both opportunities and challenges for cybersecurity:

**Quantum Threats**: Quantum computers can break current cryptographic standards (RSA-2048, ECC) in polynomial time using algorithms like Shor's algorithm, making current encryption methods obsolete.

**Quantum Opportunities**: Quantum computing offers exponential speedup for certain types of pattern recognition, optimization problems, and cryptographic operations that are fundamental to cybersecurity applications.

### Limitations of Current Hybrid Approaches

While some attempts have been made to integrate quantum computing with classical cybersecurity systems, these approaches suffer from critical limitations:

1. **Static Resource Allocation**: Existing systems do not dynamically determine when quantum vs. classical processing is optimal for specific threat analysis tasks.

2. **Lack of Real-Time Integration**: Current hybrid systems operate in batch modes that are incompatible with real-time threat response requirements.

3. **Limited Cybersecurity Focus**: General-purpose quantum-classical hybrid systems are not optimized for the specific requirements of cybersecurity applications.

4. **No Intelligent Routing**: Existing systems lack intelligent algorithms to route different types of cybersecurity analysis to optimal computing resources.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a novel hybrid quantum-classical cybersecurity architecture that dynamically allocates computational resources between quantum and classical processors based on real-time threat analysis requirements, threat complexity, and available computational resources.

### Primary Objectives

The hybrid quantum-classical cybersecurity system of the present invention addresses the limitations of prior art by providing:

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Intelligent algorithms that determine in real-time whether quantum or classical processing is optimal for specific cybersecurity analysis tasks.

2. **Adaptive Threat Routing**: Machine learning-based decision trees that route different types of cyber threats to the most appropriate computational resources.

3. **Real-Time Integration**: Seamless integration of quantum and classical processing with microsecond-level handoff capabilities.

4. **Cybersecurity Optimization**: System architecture specifically designed and optimized for cybersecurity threat detection and response workflows.

### Key Technical Innovations

**Hybrid Architecture Controller**: A novel control system that coordinates between quantum and classical processors, making real-time decisions about resource allocation based on threat characteristics, system load, and computational requirements.

**Quantum-Classical Decision Trees**: Advanced decision algorithms that analyze incoming cyber threats and determine optimal processing pathways through quantum or classical computational resources.
